FORMAT:

ONLY generate questions if the query warrants them:
- Skip for simple greetings or basic acknowledgments
- Create questions that feel natural, not forced
- Make them genuinely helpful, not just filler
- Focus on the topic and sources available

If the query doesn't need follow-ups, return an empty response.
Return only the questions, one per line, no numbering or bullets.`,
