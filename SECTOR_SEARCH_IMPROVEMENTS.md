# Sector Search Overhaul - Improvements Summary

## Overview
The sector search functionality has been completely overhauled to transform it into a powerful research tool for consultants to pull high-quality data and information.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Multi-Strategy Search Engine (`lib/search-strategies.ts`)
- **Direct API Access Strategy**: Connects directly to data source APIs (FRED, Census, etc.) for real-time, authoritative data
- **Semantic Document Search**: Uses AI embeddings to find conceptually related content beyond keyword matching
- **Pattern-Based Data Extraction**: Intelligently extracts specific data points (revenue figures, growth rates, market sizes) using advanced regex patterns
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Validates data across multiple sources to ensure accuracy
- **Parallel Execution**: All strategies run simultaneously for faster results

### 2. AI-Powered Source Discovery (`lib/ai-source-discovery.ts`)
- **Dynamic Source Finding**: Uses GPT-4 to discover new relevant sources based on query context
- **Source Quality Assessment**: Evaluates credibility (0-1 score) and relevance of discovered sources
- **Learning System**: Tracks successful sources and improves recommendations over time
- **Sector-Specific Discovery**: Tailors source discovery to specific industry sectors
- **Authority Caching**: Maintains quality scores for sources to optimize future searches

### 3. Intelligent Crawling System (`lib/intelligent-crawler.ts`)
- **Adaptive Depth Crawling**: Automatically adjusts crawl depth based on content quality
- **Smart Link Following**: Prioritizes links likely to contain relevant data
- **Multi-Format Data Extraction**:
  - Tables and structured data
  - JSON-LD and microdata
  - Pattern-based number extraction
  - Context-aware data point capture
- **Performance Optimizations**: 
  - Crawl queue prioritization
  - Duplicate detection
  - Result deduplication

### 4. Quality Scoring System (`lib/quality-scoring.ts`)
- **Multi-Dimensional Scoring**:
  - Authority Score: Source credibility (government > research firms > industry)
  - Freshness Score: Data recency evaluation
  - Completeness Score: Coverage of query topics
  - Accuracy Score: Cross-validation and citation checking
  - Relevance Score: Query-content alignment
- **Verification Status**: 
  - Verified: Data corroborated by multiple sources
  - Partial: Some data points verified
  - Unverified: Single source data
- **Cross-Reference Tracking**: Links between sources with similar data

### 5. Enhanced UI/UX (`app/search-results.tsx`)
- **Quality Indicators**: Visual badges for verification status
- **Detailed Metrics Display**: Shows all quality scores with color coding
- **Key Data Points**: Highlights extracted data in easy-to-scan format
- **Cross-Reference Indicators**: Shows when data is validated across sources
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Expandable quality metrics for detailed analysis

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **Query Analysis**: Extracts target data points and determines applicable strategies
2. **Source Discovery**: AI discovers new sources + uses pre-approved sources
3. **Multi-Strategy Search**: Parallel execution of all applicable search strategies
4. **Intelligent Crawling**: Deep crawls high-value sources with adaptive depth
5. **Quality Scoring**: Evaluates and ranks all results
6. **Learning**: System learns from successful searches for future improvement

### Integration Points
- **OpenAI API**: For semantic search and source discovery
- **Firecrawl API**: For web crawling and content extraction
- **Direct APIs**: FRED, Census, FDA, etc. for authoritative data

## Benefits for Consultants

1. **Higher Quality Data**: Multi-source validation ensures accuracy
2. **Faster Research**: Parallel strategies and intelligent crawling save time
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: AI discovers sources beyond pre-configured lists
4. **Transparent Quality**: Clear metrics show data reliability
5. **Continuous Improvement**: System learns and improves with usage

## Configuration

### Environment Variables Required
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-firecrawl-key
```

### Available Sectors
- Industrials
- TMT (Technology, Media & Telecom)
- Healthcare
- Consumer

## Future Enhancements

1. **API Integrations**: Add more direct API connections to data sources
2. **Export Functionality**: Generate reports with cited sources
3. **Collaborative Features**: Share and annotate research findings
4. **Custom Sector Configuration**: Allow users to define their own sectors
5. **Historical Tracking**: Monitor data changes over time
